The Facial Expression Dataset project aims to create models that recognise facial expressions in photographs. This dataset contains labelled photos of faces displaying a variety of emotions, including Aheago, Happy, Sad, Angry, Happy, and Neutral. The goal is to create machine learning models capable of accurately classifying these expressions.
